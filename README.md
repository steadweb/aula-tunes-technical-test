### Objective

Aula Education is branching into the music business and needs a new website. Build it using JavaScript and React.

### Brief

In a fictional world, Aula Education is branching into the music business and we need a new a website. This website needs to display the top 100 songs based on the iTunes API. This code challenge allows you to choose your own path and lets you flaunt your creative panache and technical skills along the way.

In order to help you fit the test in around other commitments, there's no time limit for the test. However, please don't feel the need to spend more than 2-3 hours total working on your solution.

### Tasks

-   Implement assignment using:
    -   Language: **JavaScript**
    -   Framework: **React**
-   Show top 100 albums based on the json feed here: `https://rss.itunes.apple.com/api/v1/us/apple-music/top-albums/all/100/non-explicit.json`
-   Allow the user to select the feed type from `top-albums`, `top-songs`, `hot-tracks` and `new-releases`, `coming-soon` - see [here](http://rss.itunes.apple.com/en-gb) for the correct url format
-   A simple design (bonus points for responsive design but this is not essential)
-   A good user experience
-   Allow the top 100 to be searchable
-   Provide tests for your application
-   Surprise us! Add a feature that you think would work well here (for instance, advanced search, integration with another API, a "Favorite" functionality)
    -   Describe the feature in a separate markdown file

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository. To make reviewing easier, include a fully built version of your assignment in a folder named **public**.

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **JavaScript** best practices
-   We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program.
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested?

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,

The Aula Education Team
